# Refocus
A lightweight jQuery plugin to focus and unfocus like a camera. Perfect for full width parallax sites.

## Javascript
Include the javascript and call it on any event, like <a href="https://api.jquery.com/load-event/">window load</a>, <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/">Waypoints</a> or <a href="https://github.com/luis-almeida/unveil">Unveil</a> with $('#id-of-the-containing-div').refocus();. Add the class focus-in to the elements you want to go from blurry to sharp, and focus-out that you want to go from sharp to blurry.

## Stylesheet
Include refocus.css and make changes in your own css-file or inline css.

## Html
